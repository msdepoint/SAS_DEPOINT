Regression Diagnostics
Estimate
The coefficient estimate (represented as Bi for variable i) is a weighted estimate generated by the logistic regression.  Each coefficient estimate represents the explanatory variable i’s marginal contribution on the log-odds:  ln( p / ( 1 - p )).

Estimate Precision
The standard error (represented as Bi for variable i) column provides a measure of the precision of each estimate.  In general, the smaller the standard error, the more precise the estimate is.

Wald Chi-Square  
Wald Chi Square is  ( Bi / Si ) ^ 2 , where Bi is the coefficient estimate of explanatory variable i and Si is the standard error of Bi .  This test statistic is used to test the statistical significance of an explanatory variable’s coefficient estimate from 0.

The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that Bi = 0.  A larger Wald Chi-Square statistic indicates that the null hypothesis can more than likely be rejected.  Rejection of the null hypothesis (given a level of confidence) indicates that coefficient estimate Bi is statistically different from 0 and, subsequently, Bi contributes to the explanation of the dependent variable.

Pr > ChiSq
Shows the significance level at which one can reject that the null hypothesis weight is equal to 0.


Empirical Logit Plots

The empirical logit plots provide a graphical representation of the influence a variable has on the binary response variable. The slope of the plots corresponds with the stated direction of influence (sign).
Means Plots provide a similar view with response by binned independent variable.

Performance

C-Statistic
The c-statistic is a measure of association that measures the predictive ability of the model.  In general, a higher value for this index (capped at a value of 1) indicates greater predictive ability.

The c-statistic also represents the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve when response is binary, such that c = ( nc + 0.5 * ( t - nc - nd ) ) / t , where nc is the number of concordant pairs, nd is the number of discordant pairs, and t is the total number of pairs.  Expression ( t - nc - nd ) represents the number of tied pairs.

The number of concordant pairs is calculated by comparing each observation where response = 1 to each observation where response = 0. If the probability of response is larger for the observation where response = 1 then the pair is considered concordant. Else if the probability of response is smaller where response = 1 then the pair is discordant. If the probability is the same then the pair is tied. 

The c-statistic can be re-written as c = ( nc / t ) + ( 0.5 * ( t - nc - nd ) / t ) ,
Effectively, c is expressed as the sum of percent of concordant to total and ½ the sum of the percent of ties to total.

KS Statistic
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) two-sample test is based on the distance between the empirical distribution functions.  The KS test statistic shows the maximum vertical separation (distance) between the cumulative distributions of events vs. non-events.  The KS statistic ranges from 0 to 100; 100 occurs when the distributions are perfectly separated.  A small or 0 separation indicates that the model is not effective.

Effectively, the KS statistic is the value where the difference between cumulative percent of goods less the corresponding cumulative percent of bads is maximized.

Stability

Variance Inflation
Variance Inflation (VI) is a measure of multicollinearity.  For each VIi (variance inflation associated with explanatory variable i ),VIi = 1 / ( 1 - Ri2 ) , where Ri2 is the R-squared value computed by regressing explanatory variable i against all other explanatory variables.

High VI corresponds to high multicollinearity.  A VI of 2.5 or above is a cause for concern and corresponds to an R2 of 0.60.  This relatively high R2 of 0.60 indicates that 60% of the variance in the explanatory variable (in question) is explained by all other explanatory variables.

Lift Tables

The following lift tables demonstrate that the score rank orders unit response.  Each lift table divides the data into roughly 10 equal (deciles) predicted response rate bands.  Rank ordering is exhibited by the consistent decline in response rate across deciles.

Following is a detailed explanation of the Modeling/Development table headings:

- Bin - Each bin represents a decile. Each decile contains approximately 10% of the population.
- Minimum Predicted Response - Minimum predicted probability of responders.
- Maximum Predicted Response - Maximum predicted probability of responders.
- Non-Cumulative Percent Response within Tile - The average predicted probability of responders within the bin.
- Cumulative Captured as Percent of Total Responders -The percentage of responders that are grouped in a particular bin and the bins above it.
- Score Bin - Each score bin represents a decile. Each decile contains approximately 10% of the population.
- Minimum Score  - Minimum score for decile.
- Maximum Score - Maximum score for decile.
- Average Score - Average score for decile.
- # Obs - Number of guests in each decile.
- Sum of Dependent - Number of guests who attrite.
- Average of Dependent - Percentage of guests in the score bin who respond.
- Percent of Dependent - Percentage of attriters in the score bin as a percentage of all respond.
- Cumulative Percent of Dependent - Total percentage of guests who respond.
