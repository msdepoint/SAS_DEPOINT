Regression Diagnostics
Estimate
The coefficient estimate (represented as Bi for variable i) is a weighted estimate generated by the logistic regression.  Each coefficient estimate represents the explanatory variable i’s marginal contribution on the log-odds:  ln( p / ( 1 - p )).

Estimate Precision
The standard error (represented as Bi for variable i) column provides a measure of the precision of each estimate.  In general, the smaller the standard error, the more precise the estimate is.

Variance Inflation
Variance Inflation (VI) is a measure of multicollinearity.  For each VIi (variance inflation associated with explanatory variable i ),VIi = 1 / ( 1 - Ri2 ) , where Ri2 is the R-squared value computed by regressing explanatory variable i against all other explanatory variables.

High VI corresponds to high multicollinearity.  A VI of 2.5 or above is a cause for concern and corresponds to an R2 of 0.60.  This relatively high R2 of 0.60 indicates that 60% of the variance in the explanatory variable (in question) is explained by all other explanatory variables.

Lift Tables

The following lift tables demonstrate that the score rank orders unit response.  Each lift table divides the data into roughly 10 equal (deciles) predicted response rate bands.  Rank ordering is exhibited by the consistent decline in response rate across deciles.

Following is a detailed explanation of the Modeling/Development table headings:

- Bin - Each bin represents a decile. Each decile contains approximately 10% of the population.
- Minimum Predicted Response - Minimum predicted probability of responders.
- Maximum Predicted Response - Maximum predicted probability of responders.
- Non-Cumulative Percent Response within Tile - The average predicted probability of responders within the bin.
- Cumulative Captured as Percent of Total Responders -The percentage of responders that are grouped in a particular bin and the bins above it.
- Score Bin - Each score bin represents a decile. Each decile contains approximately 10% of the population.
- Minimum Score  - Minimum score for decile.
- Maximum Score - Maximum score for decile.
- Average Score - Average score for decile.
- # Obs - Number of guests in each decile.
- Sum of Dependent - Number of guests who attrite.
- Average of Dependent - Percentage of guests in the score bin who respond.
- Percent of Dependent - Percentage of attriters in the score bin as a percentage of all respond.
- Cumulative Percent of Dependent - Total percentage of guests who respond.
